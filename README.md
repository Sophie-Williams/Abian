This is a network for sharing bots for [Adventure Quest Worlds](http://aq.com). 
Unlike most games where bots are used to gain an unfair advantage, AQW bots are 
primarily used to bypass the more boring and monotonous portions of the game.

## Why
Because Artix Entertainment, the company behind the game, really doesn't like 
bots. Artix has been known to submit DMCA requests to websites that distribute 
AQW bots, including 
[a previous revision of this service](http://pastebin.com/QYgp7bTb). However, 
as no copyrighted material is used, these requests are ungrounded, but that 
won't stop Atrix from sending them and it won't stop sites from taking the bots 
down for fear of legal action.

Abian seeks to solve this problem by running a website where people can freely 
create, host, and share their own bots with others.
