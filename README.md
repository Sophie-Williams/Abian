# Abian
Abian is a network for sharing bots for [Adventure Quest Worlds](htpp://aq.com) - made by Artix Entertainment - which is being built from the ground up on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/zbee_) so that developers without time to look at terrible code can still contribute.

In short, Adventure Quest Worlds is an MMORPG which means that it can get very boring and monotonous. So, you can use bots and a botting client to automate the game, and get through the icky parts and just play the fun parts yourself. However, in order to bots you have to have a bot to use. Since Artix Entertainment really doesn't like bots though, they tend to submit DMCA take down requests to websites that distribute bots. But, since [bots don't use their copyrighted material](http://pastebin.com/QYgp7bTb), these requests are invalid. Regardless of this fact, there are very few bots in circulation outside of groups of friends because no website will host them.

Abian seeks to solve this problem by running a website where people can freely create, host, and share their own bots with others.

## Financial
The Abian network will be supported financially in 3 respects

1. Ads
Ads will be the primary source of income for the network - or so I suspect - and will appear on most pages on the site in the sidebar.

2. Premium Memberships
  Users will be able to purchase a premium membership to the website for $2/month which will allow them the following privileges.
  
  * No ads
  
  * Get a free text ad in the footer
  
  * A badge on the network
  
  * The ability to use bots in the Abian online botting client without downloading them
  
  * No reCAPTCHAs when submitting comments

  * Access to a forum especially for premium members

3. Donations
Any donations received by the developers will go towards server costs first.

<hr>

And this is how the earnings from the 3 incomes will be split up and used.

Currently Abian is running off of a single droplet from Digital Ocean for `$5`/month and is hosted on a subdomain of zbee.me which is `$12`/year. Once these costs (`$6`/month) are covered, the next $(`server costs` * `4` * `developers`) will be split up evenly to the developers, currently this figure is `$24`.

The `$6` after `$30` will be saved for the next month's server costs.

The `$20` after `$36` will be saved for any emergency situation that ever arises for the website.

Anything after those `$56` will be saved until the end of the month, and at the end of the month all the money saved after `$30` will go to the creators of the bots with the most points that month.

Previously I have said that I would turn off ads after server costs and developer pay have been met, the thing that changed is that I decided for sure that I wanted to award the creators of bots with the most points in the month.
