# Abian
This is a network for sharing bots for [Adventure Quest Worlds](htpp://aq.com) - 
made by Artix Entertainment - which is being built from the ground up on 
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/zbee_) so that developers without time to look at 
terrible code can still contribute.

In short, Adventure Quest Worlds is an MMORPG which means that it can get very 
boring and monotonous. So, you can use bots and a botting client to automate 
the game, and get through the icky parts and just play the fun parts yourself. 
However, in order to bots you have to have a bot to use. Since Artix 
Entertainment really doesn't like bots though, they tend to submit DMCA take 
down requests to websites that distribute bots. But, since 
[bots don't use their copyrighted material](http://pastebin.com/QYgp7bTb), 
these requests are invalid. Regardless of this fact, there are very few bots in 
circulation outside of groups of friends because no website will host them.

Abian seeks to solve this problem by running a website where people can freely 
create, host, and share their own bots with others.
